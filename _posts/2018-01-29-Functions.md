In this lesson we were introduced to functions, this included what they were, what they did and what they did within a computer program. During the lesson our teacher gave us templates to use so that we had a simple yet thought provoking introduction to programing the functions. I think that this worked well as it helped me understand the base knowledge of what we needed to know about ho to implement the functions to improve our code. I think that what limited my work was that i didn't have an understanding of when do put in punctuation such as brackets, commas, full stops, hyphens, colons and any other relevant punctuation.
