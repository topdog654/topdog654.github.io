This lesson we recapped function and how they can be used more efficiently in our code. We started the lesson by watching our teacher write out some code involving questions with multiple choice answers. Our teacher then posted his code onto google classroom for us to copy and paste onto the coding website that we use called repl.it. This code was deliberately wrong and it was our task to find out what was incorrect and then correct it. Unfortunately i didn't understand the functions very well so was not very good at finding out the problem with the code so i wasn't able to complete the assignment.

I think that this lesson wasn't very productive as i felt that i didn't understand the topic however next time i will ask the teacher if i am stuck so that i can improve my understanding on the topic.
