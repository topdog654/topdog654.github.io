In year 7 i learnt about coding, different parts of the computer, my personality and internet safety. When learning about coding we used scratch which i enjoyed because it was an easy way to code.

 One of the weaknesses that i have found out about myself is that i am a slow learner. However i have found that i enjoy IT most of the time and it's not my least favourite subject any more.
