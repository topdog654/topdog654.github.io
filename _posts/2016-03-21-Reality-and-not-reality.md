Today in the lesson we talked about how adverts and reality TV can sometimes not be true. We looked at an advert where a man asked to go to the airport but instead of a human driving him it was an ape. We talked about all the fantasy in it and also how it can make you want to consume the product. Next we looked at a Mc Donalds advert where they answered the question of how the food that they give to customers looks different to that in the adverts. They then proceeded to make a burger that they would use the same ingredients but cook and sculpt it in a way to make it look better that the shops didn't do.

I think the lesson went well because i made me realise that things aren't real just because they are on TV.

Next lesson i would improve by trying to answer more questions.
