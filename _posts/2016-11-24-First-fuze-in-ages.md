In today's lesson we used our fuze boxes for the first time in ages. Me and harry decided to split they work fairly.      

Today we coded a game into the box. The game was guess the number. We had 10 chances to guess the correct number. If you got a number wrong it would say if it was too high or too low.

Today I learnt that I could program simple games with ease and that I shouldn't get worried about complicated looking code when actually it was quite simple.
