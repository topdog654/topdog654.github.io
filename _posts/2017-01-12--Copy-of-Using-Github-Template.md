    <td>In todays lesson i mostly listened to Mr Keen speak. This helped me develop my listening skills. Today i learnt about not giving up and the two types of failure. We also watched a video about a japanese boy who was attempting to do a vault. He failed his first few attempts but he was not allowed to give up. In the end he got the vault. </td>
