This lesson we mostly went over the stuff that we had learnt in the previous lessons as we are going to be completing things like the system that we had done as a group during the last lesson however this time we will be doing it by ourselves. The system that we will be attempting to code into sheets is a system that will be able to work as a till machine, the machine must be able to add up the costs of multiple different items of clothing.
