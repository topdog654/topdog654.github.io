Today I didn't have a very productive lesson because for the first twenty minutes i was unable that do any coding because my computer decided not to work. We then narrowed the problem down to a faulty cable that mr keen the on replaced but still it didn't work so we moved to a new computer. 

As well as the faulty cable hindering my work I also had to leave for a football match half way through the lesson so altogether it wasn't a very productive lesson. However I did learn that trial and error does work in the end.
