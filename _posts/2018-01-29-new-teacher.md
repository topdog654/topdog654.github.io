This lesson we had a new teacher and started a new, one off topic called compressing. Compressing is where you have an image and you write down in simple language the colour that each square of the image is, for example if you were to have an image that the top line was sky with the top of a tree for a few squares and the sky then the compression could be '6b 3g 6b' eg. 6 blue squares, 3 green squares, 6 blue squares. This lesson was fun as we got to design our own pictures on the program google sheets and then compress it leaving our partners to re-draw our image from our compressions.
