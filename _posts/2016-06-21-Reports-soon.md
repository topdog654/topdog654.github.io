Today in the lesson we learnt about how not to leave the homework set by Mr keen until the last minute as this annoys him greatly because if you have a problem then he won't have enough time to sort it out. We also learnt that we had to have a separate folder for IT as it would help us keep our google drive organised and easy to use.

In the lesson we had to get all of the things done that we hadn't in order for Mr Keen to be able to accurately write our reports.
