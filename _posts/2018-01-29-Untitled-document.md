This lesson we learnt to implement different options for a multiple choice question. For example this could mean if the question was 'do you like baked beans?', the answers could be, ‘a. Yes b. Maybe c. No’. This lesson were able to create our first code that did not begin as a template. I found this more challenging step of our course more challenging as we had no help or hint fromt the previous code as to what to do or what numbers to put in.

I think that this lesson was the least productive on my half because i had no idea as to what to do and write in the code and we had no help from examples of previous code.
