Today we learnt about what social media used for and its positive and negative effects. We wrote out a list of the uses and then put a tick or cross to the ones that we thought that we thought were positive or negative. From this we learnt that there are only a few bad things that's social media are used for.These include Sexting, porn and bullying. We then moved on to learning about what the three negatives were.

Once Mr Keen had given us the definitions he then explained to us why porn and Sexting was so bad, this then led him to telling us about revenge porn which is where people use the explicit images that someone has sent them for acts of revenge or for their own personal gain.
