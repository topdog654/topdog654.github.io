In today's lesson we coded all the time. Me and Harry worked well as a team. Harry being the best coder explained the work to me and guided me on my way.

In the lesson we coded the colour of the ink that is lime green and also made a start on the variables. However when we started we were doing very well when the computer crashed and we lost all of our work. Hopefully next week our computer won't crash.
