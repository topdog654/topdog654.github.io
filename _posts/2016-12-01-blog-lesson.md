In today's lesson i fiddled with my blog. I changed the background, the text colour and the title colour. Today i learnt that you need to persevere with IT because there’s a lot of trial and error so without patience you won’t get very far. I have also learnt that you can’t just rely on your teacher to help you if you’re stuck you have to try to figure it out yourself and only ask them as a last result.
