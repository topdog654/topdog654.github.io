Today in IT i did some modifications to my github account. The main one that i did was the background that you see today. At first i was unsure on how to accomplish my aim but after getting some help from my friends i managed to figure it out, however i am still to figure out how to keep the background in one place when i scroll down the page. 

In todays lesson i have learnt perseverance and attitude is vital to being good at it because you need to have patience when tackling some harder assignments.
